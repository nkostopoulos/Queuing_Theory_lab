# Queuing_Theory_lab
Queuing Theory Laboratory, 6th semester, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering  
  
This repository includes demonstration files provided to students to help them in their exercises.  
  
demo1: plotting Poisson processes of different lambda parameters, convolution of two independent Poisson processes of parameters lambda1 and lambda2 to show that the new process is Poisson with lambda parameter lambda1 + lambda2,
mean value and variance of Poisson process, Binomial Distribution convergence to the Poisson process.  
  
demo2: simulation of M/M/1/K queue with queueing package of Octave (Moreno Marzolla)  
  
demo3: simulation of a M/M/1 queue with traditional method of Markov Simulations  
  
demo6: simulation of a closed system. Two queues in cascade. Number of clients = 3.
